# Card Game of Snap.

**This project is created with the following technology:**

1. .Net Core 5 and C#
1. NUnit 3
1. Moq

As per the **_instructions / requirement_**, this is approximately 2 hour of effort / work - therefore it is by no means complete.

I've laid out most of the core domain components for this card game.  If more time was available, I would like to have implemented the following:

1. Implement the main game loop and logic.
2. Implement the logic to sort the Hand by Suit
3. Implement the logic to sort the Hand by Rank / value.
4. Add more unit tests
